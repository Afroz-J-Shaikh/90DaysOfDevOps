# Linux File System Hierarchy (the most important directories)
## Let's understand where things live in Linux 

## Core Directories (Must Know):

* `/ (root)` - The base of entire file system. All other directories branch from here.

               I would use this to get into the root of Linux file system.

* `/home` - Home directories of users. Contains personal directories for each user. 
            They can use their own home directory without requiring permissions.
            
            I would use this to list home directories of all users.

* `/root` - Home directory of super user (root user) separate from normal users.

            I would use this to store files that only root should acsess.

* `/etc` - It contains configuration files of services, applications and the system itself. 
           Also contains cnfiguraion files of users and passwords.
           
           `/etc/environment`: I would use this to add environment variables so they’re accessible globally.
            
           `etc/adduser.conf`: I would use this to configure defaults for new users like shell, directory or group.

* `/var/log` - Contains log files generated by services, application and operating system. 
               These logs are critical for troubleshooting, monitoring and auditing.

               `auth.log` : I would use this to check logs related to authentication.
               
               `syslog` : I would use this tview general system and service related logs.
               
* `/tmp` - Temporary files created by applications, services, or users are stored here. 
           Any files stored here will be deleted after reboot.
           I would use this to store any files that I won't require after reboot.

## Additional Directories (Good to Know):

* `/bin` - Symbolic link to /usr/bin.

* `/usr/bin` - Contains the majority of user command binaries — programs and utilities that regular users 
               and administrators run in daily work. (ex. ls, mkdir, mv)
               I would use this to look for commands.


* `/opt` - Reserved for installing optional 3rd party software that are not part of core system distribution. 
           (ex. google chrome)
           I would use this directory to to see what external or commercial applications are installed.
           
           
# Scenario-Based Practice 

## Scenario 1: Service Not Starting
A service called 'ssh' failed to start after a server reboot.
What commands would you run to diagnose the issue?
Write at least 4 commands in order.

Step 1 : `systemctl status ssh`
Why : Check if the service is running or failed or stopped.

Step 2 : `journalctl -u ssh -n 50`
Why : If service is failed check logs.

Step 3 : `systemctl is-enabled ssh`
Why : To check if service starts automatically on boot.

## Scenario 2: High CPU Usage
Your manager reports that the application server is slow.
You SSH into the server. What commands would you run to identify
which process is using high CPU?

Step 1 : `top/htop`
Why : List all the running processes. Check for processes that are CPU intensive.

Step 2 : `ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10`
Why : Sort the processes by CPU percentage. Note down PID of top processes.

Step 3 : `sudo renice +10 -p PID`
Why : Increases the nice value, lowering the process priority so it gets less CPU time. Useful if you don't want to
      kill the process but need to reduce its impact.

Step 4 : `kill PID`
Why : Kill CPU intensive processes if necessary.

## Scenario 3: Finding Service Logs
A developer asks: "Where are the logs for the 'ssh' service?"
The service is managed by systemd.
What commands would you use?

Step 1 : `systemctl status ssh`
Why : Check service status first.

Step 2 : `journalctl -u ssh -n 50`
Why : Check last 50 lines of logs.

Step 3 : `journalctl -u ssh -f`
Why : Check logs real-time.

## Scenario 4: File Permissions Issue
A script at /home/user/backup.sh is not executing.
When you run it: ./backup.sh
You get: "Permission denied"
What commands would you use to fix this?

Step 1 : `ls -l demo.sh`
Why : Check current permissions of file. Look for: -rw-r--r-- (notice no 'x' = not executable).

Step 2 : `chmod +x demo.sh`
Why : Add execute permission to file.

Step 3: `ls -l demo.sh`
Why : Verify it worked. Look for: -rwxr-xr-x (notice 'x' = executable).

Step 4: `./demo.sh`
Why : Run it.
